<section>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
The Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin Reference method has minimal design goals: a DID trust anchor based on the Bitcoin blockchain, updates publicly visible and auditable via Bitcoin transactions, and optionally, additional DID Document information referenced in the transaction OP_RETURN data field. No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.
  </p>
  <p>
A secondary intent of the BTCR method is to serve as a very conservative, very secure example and some best practices for creating a DID method. The use cases for BTCR are focused on anonymous and pseudo-anonymous identities, web-of-trust style webs of identity, and absolute mimimal personal information disclosure. Other DID methods will likely need to loosen these standards.
  </p>
  <p>
Some aspects of the BTCR method will not be practical if inappropriately scaled â€” for instance, there is a transaction cost to update keys and DDO object, potential UTXO inflation (i.e. one additional unspent output for every BTCR-based identity), and even if segwit isn't used it could cause blockchain bloat. However, identities using the BTCR method can be a strong as Bitcoin itself -- currently securing billions of dollars of digital value.

  <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>BTCR DID Format</h2>

    <p>
BTCR DIDs have the following format:
    </p>

    <pre class="nohighlight">
      btcr-did        = "did:btcr:" btcr-identifier
                       [ ";" did-service ] [ "/" did-path ]
                       [ "?" did-query ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
      btcr-identifier = txref-ext encoded transaction
    </pre>


<p class="issue"
      title="Need to finalize encoding of transaction">
BTCR uses TX references that deviate from Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References. <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/1">didm-btcr issue 1</a>

Once the above issue is decided, btcr-identifier format should be defined similar to 
<a href="https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/c83837536d6629f754ce5a88bbe245e0a615e76e/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Position_References.mediawiki">Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References</a>
    </p>

    <p>
BTCR DID identifiers are a TXREF-EXT encoding of the DID creation/update transaction.

This encoding is based on <a href="https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/c83837536d6629f754ce5a88bbe245e0a615e76e/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Position_References.mediawiki">Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References</a>, but with the following modifications:

<ol>
  <li>Remove network prefixes (e.g. txtest1)</li>
  <li>Future: support for specifying tx output</li>
  <li>Future: support lightning ids</li>
</ol>

    </pre>

  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>Authentication</h2>

    <p>
Authentication is the process the ledger uses to determine if an entity
is associated with a DID. By convention, BTCR grants the transaction signing key the ability to authenticate. Authentication is the only default ability; meaning that if there is no continuation DID Document, then authentication with the transaction signing key is the only ability granted by the BTCR DID.
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Expressing authentication credentials">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/btcr/v1",
  "id": "did:btcr:xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn",
  <span class="highlight">"authentication": [... array of acceptable authentication suites ...]</span>
}
    </pre>

    <p>
A detailed example of a valid set of authentication credentials follows:
    </p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Detailed example of authentication credentials entry">{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/btcr/v1",
  "id": "did:btcr:xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn",
  "authentication": [{
    "type": "EdDsaSAPublicKeySecp256k1Authentication",
    "publicKey": {
      "id": "did:btcr:xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn#keys-1",
      "type": "EdDsaSAPublicKeySecp256k1",
      "owner": "did:btcr:xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn",
      "publicKeyHex": "0280e0b456b9e97eecb8028215664c5b99ffa79628b60798edd9d562c6db1e4f85"
    }
  }],
  ...</pre>
    
  </section>

  <section>

    <h2>Continuation DID Documents</h2>

    <p>
Because BTCR DIDs have very limited capabilities (authentication with the tx signing key), BTCR uses the concept of continuation documents to provide additional key material, capabilities, and service endpoints. 
    </p>

    <p>
The continuation DID document is referenced by a link from the transaction OP_RETURN field. The continuation DID document must be signed in one of the following ways:

  <ol>
    <li>Continuation DID document is stored in an immutable store. In this case, the signature on the transaction suffices to sign the continuation DID document.</li>
    <li>Continuation DID document is signed with the transaction signing key, along with a timestamp. This is necessary if the document is in a mutable store; otherwise the document can be changed at any time.
    </li>
  </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
Immutable storage for the DID document is preferred. A DID document in a mutable store _must_ be signed exactly once with the timestamp.  
    </p>


    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      TODO: in mutable case, are there any restrictions on delta btw tx timestamp and DID document timestamp? </li>
      <li>
        TODO: where did we land on presence of @id in mutable store case. Must it be present, in which case the document can only be updated after the tx is confirmed.
      </li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Creating a DID</h2>

    <p>
A BTCR DID is created by creating a Bitcoin transaction with an optional OP_RETURN data field referring to additional DID document material, as described in this section.
    </p>

    <p>
Abbreviations:
<ul>
  <li> Bi = bitcoin address i </li>
  <li> Pi = public key i </li>
  <li> Si = signing key i (or private key i) </li>
</ul>
    </p>

    <p>
Creating the initial BTCR DID:
<ol>
  <li> Create key set (B0/P0/S0) </li>
  <li> Create key set (B1/P1/S1) </li>
  <li> Create Bitcoin transaction: 
    <ul>
      <li> Output: Change address B1 </li>
      <li> Optional output: OP_RETURN <link to DDO continuation> </li>
      <li> Signing key is S0, which reveals public key P0 in the transaction </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Issue TX0 and wait for confirmation. <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/7">didm-btcr issue 7</a></li>
  <li> Get Extended TX Ref encoding of the confirmed transaction TXREF(TX0) <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-btcr/issues/1">didm-btcr issue 1</a></li>

</ol>
At this point we have a DID of the format did:btcr:TXREF(TX0). 
</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reading a DID</h2>
    <p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the transaction references from the BTCR DID (i.e. did:btcr:TXREF(TX0)) </li>
  <li>Look up transaction. Is the transaction output spent?
    <ul>
      <li> no: this is the latest version of the DID. From this we can construct the DID Description (described below)</li>
      <li> yes: keep following transaction chain until the latest with an unspent output is found</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/pull/74"> BTCR resolver</a> for additional details. TODO: merge in
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Updating a DID</h2>
    <p>
An entity updates the BTCR DID Description by spending the current transaction output. The BTCR Transaction Structure diagram shows how that is done in this second transaction.

<ol>
  <li> Create new tx like above, but send to B2 </li>
  <li> Set the OP_RETURN to the new DID Description </li>
  <li> Sign tx with S1 (P1 is revealed) </li>
</ol>
    </p>

  <h1>Versioning</h1>
  <p>
Version of this Specification
[Define how this spec will be versioned. This SHOULD be by using the ReSpec template and standard ReSpec versioning mechanism.]]
Version of the JSON-LD Context
[Define how your JSON-LD context will be versioned. This MUST use the mechanism defined in the DID spec.]]
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
  <p>

Requirements from Method Spec Template definition:
<pre>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle.  

Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.  

If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, it should be clearly indicated which portions of the data are protected and what the protections are (i.e., integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint authentication, etc.). 

Some indication should also be given to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible.  

Data which should be held secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly labeled. 

If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly specified.

Residual risks (such as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher) after threat mitigation has been deployed.

This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section 7 of this specification (DID Operations).
